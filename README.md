`arc_curvature_data.txt` contains the fitted arc curvatures (and other ancillary data) for a set of observations of PSR J1603-7202 from 2004 to 2016

`J1603-7202.par` contains various measured parameters of J1603-7202, including RA & DEC position, binary period, proper motion, etc.

`model_J1603.py` is the modelling script for fitting the arc curvatures to the scintools `arc_curvature` model
